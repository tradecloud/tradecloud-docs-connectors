# WebSockets

Websockets are currently experimental for system integration.

* you can [subscribe to the order WebSocket](https://swagger-ui.accp.tradecloud1.com/?url=https://api.accp.tradecloud1.com/v2/order/specs.yaml#/order/orderWebSocketRoute) using an JSON Web Token for authentication
* a [Subprotocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-1.9) like [STOMP](https://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html) is missing at this moment
* you will NOT receive missed historic orders or responses since the WebSocket disconnected
* you have to keep the connection open by sending a keep alive message every minute

Contact support@tradecloud1.com if you would like to integrate using WebSockets
{% endhint %}

Roadmap:

1. Add a WebSocket Connector targetted on system integration
2. Add basic authentication for easy authentication
3. Queue orders and responses when the WebSocket client is not connected or subscribed.
4. Add the STOMP protocal for CONNECT, SUBSCRIBE, ACK, UNSUBSCRIBE and DISCONNECT
