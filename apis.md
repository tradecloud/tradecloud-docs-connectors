# API's

The Tradecloud API's provide commands and queries on orders, shipments, forecasts etc.

Tradecloud provides two API's:

* [API version 2](https://docs.tradecloud1.com/api/), which is recommended and part of the new Tradecloud One platform. 
* [API version 1](https://tradecloud.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/524298/API+v1), which is deprecated and part of the legacy Tradecloud platform.
